        this takes the raw stream generator and yields 'streaming turn' objects
        as tokens come in.

        this way, we can display each segment throughout the UI, seperately,
        using whatever layout and components we want!

        it's basically a state machine that groups tokens into segments.
        a segment is just a group of tokens of the same type.

        unlike normal streaming deltas, these tokens accumulate,
        and are meant to be used in UI's where you can fully replace the content of a UI component
        with the new content with the newly streamed tokens added

        since an assistant response can contain multiple kinds of content in sequence,
        like reasoning -> content -> tool_calls -> tool responses -> more reasoning -> final answer (reasoning+content)
        we need to track when the type changes so we can create a new segment.

        it creates a clear separation between types of content,
        where all you ever need to do is create a new UI element when the segment type changes,
        without worrying about merging the different types of tokens manually

        this used to be exclusive to the webUI, handled in the frontend.
        but since this is now in the core, it can be used in *ANY* channel.

        the state machine works like this:
        - if the token type changes, we create a new segment and start filling it
        - if the token type stays the same, we keep appending to the current segment
        - for tool responses, we don't yield them as segments,
