# Final notes to the AI:
# - The user must copy the created user channel to the openlumara user channels folder (defaults to user_channels, but the path can be manually set by the user)
# - The user must restart openlumara, which will make openlumara detect the new user channel. Then, the user must enable the channel within the config using either the webUI's settings panel, using `/channel module_name_in_snake_case`, or manually editing their config file.
# - The channel will then be activated and ready for use.
# - Any syntax errors from the channel will show up in the console logs. If there is not enough information, the user can use the `--debug` flag when starting openlumara, to see more detail about errors.
